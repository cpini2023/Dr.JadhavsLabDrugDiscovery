        <p>
        After obtaining a Bachelor and Masters degrees in pharmacy from the Pune University (India) in 1998, Dr Gopal spent a year working as a synthetic chemist and three years working as Lecturer of Medicinal chemistry in India, before undertaking a PhD at the University of Nottingham, UK. He completed Ph D under the supervision of Dr S R Chhabra, Prof. Peter Fischer, Prof. David Pritchard and Prof. Barrie Kellam and  continued to work for five years as post-doctoral research fellow on following projects.<br>
        
        1) Cancer Research project funded by BBSRC, UK, focusing on the work involving Computer aided designing and synthesis of small chemical molecules as inhibitors of pRb-E7 interactions. <br>

        2) Seeding Drug Discovery project funded by Wellcome Trust, UK focusing on the Synthesis of novel chemicals and lead optimization of new highly selective beta-blockers in the management of cardiovascular disorders. <br>

        3) project funded by MRC, UK, focusing on Development of Inhibitors of Human deadnylase enzyme, new treatment for the Osteoporosis.<br>

        Subsequently, Dr Gopal spent one and a half years as a senior research scientist at the RD Alternative Discovery & Development, GlaxoSmithKline (Madrid Trescants, Spain) where he worked on collaborative-project with Prof. Michael Pollastri (Northeastern University, USA) and Prof. Harry De Koning (University of Glasgow, UK), involving structural optimization of GSK675728A, hPDE4 inhibitor to generate novel pharmacophore(s) as potent TbrPDE1 inhibitors that are selective over hPDEs in the management of African sleeping sickness (CNS disorder). 
        Dr Gopal joined Creighton University in June 2016 as Postdoctoral research fellow and promoted to Assistant Professor of medicinal chemistry in early 2017. He is working as assistant professor within the school of Medicine under the leadership of Dr Peter Abel.</p>
